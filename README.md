As it is best practive to use a password manager with one strong master password for most users, I have written a program to make sure your master password is secure using the NIST (National Insitute of Standards and Technology) password standards.

This program promts a user for a password, and will check if the password is complex enough and will check if it has been compromised against the "Have I Been Pwned" password database, which is a collection of currently discovered compromised passwords. 
If it is either not complex enough or compromised, a new auto-generated secure password will be provided to the user.
